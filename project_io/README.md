Project IO Directory
--------------------

This directory is where you would place a database dump and files archive to import an existing project into your VM.
This guest load script will import files from this directory, and the host save script will save files to this directory.

Files should be named as follows to work with the script:
${PROJECTFOLDER}.sql
${PROJECTFOLDER}.tgz
